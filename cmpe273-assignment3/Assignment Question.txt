We can use below formula to calculate the bit array size:

m = - (n * log(p)) / (log(2)^2) 

where,

m = bit array size
n = number of expected keys to be stored
p = Probability of desired false positive rate

For one million keys: (Assuming p=0.05)

m = - (1000000 * log(0.05) / (log(2)^2)
m = 14357134

The no of k hashes can be calculated using below formula:

k = ln(2) * m/n
k = 9.95 => 10
